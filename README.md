# odd number check
Inspiration
The idea came from a simple yet intriguing question: "Is this number odd?" While it sounds straightforward, we saw an opportunity to create a playful yet educational app that leverages cutting-edge technologies. By combining frontend tools like React and Vite with a Flask backend, we aimed to create an interactive and responsive tool that answers this question in a fun way.

What it does
"Wait Hold on is this odd?" is a web app that checks if a number is odd. Users input a number, and the app instantly determines whether it’s odd or even. The app’s sleek interface, built with TailwindCSS, ensures a seamless user experience. It also uses the Gemini API to enhance functionality, such as fetching random facts about odd numbers or displaying trivia for extra engagement.

How we built it
Frontend: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
Backend: Flask, GeminiAPI
Challenges we ran into
API Integration: Understanding the Gemini API documentation and integrating it seamlessly was initially challenging.
Cross-Origin Issues: We encountered CORS errors while connecting the frontend and Flask backend, which required setting up proper headers.
UI/UX Balance: Creating an interface that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing within time constraints was tricky.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully combining multiple technologies into a cohesive project within a limited timeframe.
Implementing real-time updates with the Gemini API for dynamic content.
Creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
Overcoming technical hurdles like CORS and API rate limits.
What we learned
Effective integration of frontend and backend technologies.
Best practices for managing API calls and handling errors.
Advanced TailwindCSS techniques to create responsive and polished designs.
The importance of planning and modular coding in a team setting.
What's next for Wait Hold on is this odd?
